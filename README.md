## Merchant Registry System

This repository is dedicated to the development of a merchant payment system
using Mojaloop for seamless merchant transactions. The system allows consumers
to pay merchants using mobile wallets with interoperability.

In this current phase, we are focused on implementing the acquiring system and
merchant registry, which will serve as an oracle in the payment process.

The Mojaloop's Account Lookup Service will interact with the merchant registry
and proceed with the necessary steps in the payment transaction.
